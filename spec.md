# Student ~~S~~Boup

A learning and social space built around a common set of tools: courses and educational content, tutoring, and study groups all with access to a code editor, calculator, graphing tools, whiteboard, notebook, chat, and more.

## A modular set of tools that makes teaching and learning easier, _modular = expandable by anyone_:
- whiteboard
- calculator
- code editor
- graphing tools
- electrical diagrams (Fritzing)
- notebook
- screenshare

## Apps built around these tools
Patreon-like model for pricing (set your own prices for teaching and tutoring)
### courses/classes
All users are also content creators and can teach others any topic they are passionate about. Others can subscribe to their favorite teachers (Twitch model) and will get notified of live class sessions and classes-on-demand. Subscribers can ask the teacher questions during a class session, all other users can ask each other (peers) questions.

Class sessions are recorded and all questions are put in a timeline, so teachers can see what parts of their class had the most questions (need to be elaborated on) and future students viewing the recording can have their questions answered by peers (SoundCloud comment style).

### tutoring
Either favorite a tutor and work with them or, if they're unavailable (offline), get matched with the first available online tutor (Uber).

### study groups
Chat room for doing work with friends. Can be persistent or not. Can be public?

## Social
Friends. See their progress, achievements, enrolled courses. Share courses with your friends first, invite them to audit and try it out, etc.

Initially make things restrictive (small groups/classes) and expand as user base and demand for larger size grows.

A test or pilot if you will of our own little platform will be a stream of the creation of it, like a devlog in the form of a class.
